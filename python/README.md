# Learning to Code in Python

Welcome to our "Learning to Code in Python" series! This is the material we'll work with for our Python meetups. The first one is coming up on July 16, 2020.

## Learning to Code in Python Part I: Python Environment Setup

Our first session will focus on the Python environment setup that is most commonly used for data science and machine learning. We'll be installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#requirements), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). We plan to go through the following:

- Making sure everyone has Python on their computer
- Downloading and installing [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- Creating a Conda environment
- Installing PyTorch with Conda
- Starting and using a Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook will contain [code from this tutorial](https://medium.com/biaslyai/pytorch-linear-and-logistic-regression-models-5c5f0da2cb9), which we don't plan to cover line by line until our future session, Part II. But feel free to take a look at the tutorial ahead of time.

## Getting Started: Installation
- Let's follow each part below, in order, so that we can get to the fun part -- to learn about Python and PyTorch using a Jupyter notebook!
- Note that the steps below were tested on a machine running macOS Catalina version 10.15.5. If you run into any issues, try to paste any error messages that you encounter into Google and see if others have encountered the same problems. Also please don't hesitate to ask us on Slack or on meetup.com! It's possible that you'll have to change a few steps here and there when installing on Windows or Linux.

### Part 1. Install Anaconda
- What is **Anaconda**? You'll get to read all about it in **Part 2** (feel free to take a look at the first paragraph of Part 2 below now or later).
1. Let's follow the install instructions for Mac here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/, following only the instructions under the "macOS graphical install" section -- let's disregard anything under the "Using the command-line install" section.
    - For Windows, follow: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
    - For Linux, follow: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
1. Click on the `macOS installer` link in step 1 of the document and click on the Download button at the top, beneath "Your data science toolkit." The page will scroll down to the very bottom, where you should select the "64-Bit Graphical Installer (442 MB)" beneath "MacOS" for "Python 3.7." Continue by clicking Save (saving it to your Downloads folder is fine).
1. Click on the `.pkg` file you just downloaded, Open it, and click Continue if prompted with "This package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed."
1. Within this document, let's continue with steps 4 and onwards https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/, taking note of the following:
    - Click a series of Continue and Agree buttons
    - Skip step 6 in this document, as we'd prefer to install Anaconda in the default location
    - Skip step 8 as well (by clicking Continue), since we're not going to install PyCharm
    - Upon step 9, click Close to hide the installer window; it's also totally fine to click "Move to Trash" as we won't be needing the installer itself anymore
    - For step 10, follow the "macOS" step under the "Anaconda Navigator" section -- let's ignore the "Conda" section
1. Following through on step 10 of the installation document, you can open the Anaconda Navigator by pressing CMD+Space on your keyboard, which will open up Spotlight Search. Type in "Anaconda Navigator" and press Enter to open it on your Mac.
1. Feel free to deselect the checkbox "Yes, I'd like to help improve Anaconda" and then click "Ok, and don't show again."
1. Since Anaconda Navigator is now open on your Mac, you have successfully installed Anaconda!

### Part 2. Create a Conda environment
- What exactly is **Conda** and how does it differ from **Anaconda**? **Conda is a software (package) manager and an environment manager**, whereas **Anaconda is a software distribution**, which is just a fancy way of saying that it's **a collection of different software bundled together**. Anaconda's main purpose is to make it easier for data science and machine learning practitioners to get started building something. Conda, on the other hand, can create different environments (essentially different folders on your machine) and install different software to those environments. Without Conda or some other type of environment manager, you would run into a lot more issues trying to install or run various software, which might require different or older versions of some other software before they can run successfully. Conda makes it much easier to switch between different versions of Python, for example (versions 2 and 3 are very different).
1. With the Anaconda Navigator still open, let's click on the Environments tab in the left sidebar, below Home.
1. In the bottom left corner, click the Create button. Python 3.7 should be selected by default. Let's name our environment `python-ml` and click Create. You should see on the right that Anaconda has installed some default packages that come with your newly-created environment.

1. Now let's click back on Home in the leftmost sidebar.

### Part 3. Install Jupyter Notebook
- What is **Jupyter Notebook**? Jupyter Notebook is software that runs in your browser and serves the purpose of a physical notebook. It differs from the way programmers traditionally write code in that every single section or "cell" of the notebook can execute your code and print results, even if you didn't specifically tell the program to write something out to screen. These "code cells" that contain Python code can also be turned into "Markdown cells." **Markdown** cells allow you to write Markdown, which is a markup language (essentially, this means it allows you to format text, as you would when writing in a physical notebook by writing hyphens for lists or underlining/starring things as headers).
- But how do programmers traditionally write code? Normally, programmers would write all of their logic in one or multiple files and then manually have to run their programs, which takes extra steps. With Jupyter Notebook, however, it's much faster to iterate on small snippets of code at a time, so that we can see what's going on with our program before moving on to the next few lines of code. To run a code cell, you can simply press Shift+Enter to execute the code and see what happens.
- Why does it seem that a lot of people in data science and machine learning like Jupyter Notebook? The steps taken from problem to solution in data science or machine learning are often long and tedious -- so very many steps that it's incredibly easy to make a mistake without checking the output, without stopping to see what's going on with a line of code before moving on. Therefore, Jupyter Notebook makes it easy to experiment, to "check our work" when it comes to writing code for data science and machine learning. Eventually, these same people might move their code from Jupyter Notebook to Python scripts (files ending in `.py`) before using the code in a real-world scenario.
- For clarity, the term "Jupyter Notebook" or "Jupyter" is in reference to the name of the software itself. When we talk about "Jupyter notebook" with a lowercase "n," we're simply referring to any notebook that you create or use from the "Jupyter Notebook" or "Jupyter" software. Thus, a "Jupyter Notebook notebook" is akin to saying "Campbell'sÂ® Soups soup."
1. With the Anaconda Navigator home page still open, in the top left-hand corner, select `python-ml` from the dropdown menu if it's not already selected.
1. We should already see Jupyter Notebook on the home page, with an Install button right beneath it. Let's click on the Install button for Jupyter Notebook.

1. After Jupyter completes installation, we should see it on the home page with a Launch button (instead of an Install button). Let's now click on the Launch button. In the process, you'll see a terminal window open (Mac by default comes installed with the Terminal application) that will launch Jupyter by running some code and opening up a new browser tab in your default browser.
1. You should now see http://localhost:8888/tree open in your browser, along with different folders in your home user account, such as Applications, Desktop, Documents, and Downloads.

## Working with Terminal and Conda
- What is the **Terminal** application? The "terminal" or "command line" is another way for us to access the contents of our computer, without any visual cues other than lines of text. There's no concept of clicking around. To mimic what we do on a computer, we need to type **commands** to tell the terminal or command line what to do. For example, typing `ls` in the terminal will show you a **list** of folders in your current folder. While you're using the terminal, note that **you're always in a folder** (as if you have the Finder application open on your Mac).
- How else can I access the terminal or command line? The Terminal application on Mac is not the only way. There are other software that exist to allow you to access your computer via the terminal or command line. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is one example that allows even more customization of your terminal.
- Why do we need terminal or command line access? We won't be learning much about the terminal or command line, other than the most basic commands. But we need to use it in this tutorial because that's the only way (at least that we know of) to **set your Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook**.
1. First off, let's launch the Terminal application on the Mac. If it's already running, let's quit it by clicking on Terminal in the very top left of your screen and selecting Quit Terminal (or you can type CMD+Q as a shortcut). Click the Terminate button if you're asked to terminate running processes in the window. Now let's launch the Terminal application again.

## Using Jupyter Notebook

### Part 1. Create a new notebook -- TODO
1. Now that we have Jupyter open in a browser tab, let's click on the New button and select "Python 3."
1. Hooray, you've just created your first Jupyter notebook!

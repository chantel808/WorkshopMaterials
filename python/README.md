# Learning to Code in Python

Welcome to our "Learning to Code in Python" series! This is the material we'll work with for our Python meetups. The first one is coming up on July 16, 2020.

## Learning to Code in Python Part I: Python Environment Setup

Our first session will focus on the Python environment setup that is most commonly used for data science and machine learning. We'll be installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#requirements), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). We plan to go through the following:

- Making sure everyone has Python on their computer
- Downloading and installing [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- Creating a Conda environment
- Installing PyTorch with Conda
- Starting and using a Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook will contain [code from this tutorial](https://medium.com/biaslyai/pytorch-linear-and-logistic-regression-models-5c5f0da2cb9), which we don't plan to cover line by line until our future session, Part II. But feel free to take a look at the tutorial ahead of time.
